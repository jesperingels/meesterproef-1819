# Summary
## Problem
Users can't find what they are looking for when searching through the data with the ISD website. They don't understand all the different tables and input fields that have to be filled in before they even get any results. This bad user experience results in the fact that none of the four target groups are able to find what they are looking for in the way they want to look for it.

## Design Challenge
Create an application that enables the user to search the NHS database more effectively. Improve the overall user experience in a way that the target group will find it easy and helpful to use the app.

## Stakeholders
* **NHS Scotland**
    Provide data in cooperation with ISD.
* **ISD Scotland**
    Provide data to the users, through their online platform.
* **Wallscope**
    Create solutions, to make data more manageable. So that users do not get lost in a maze of data, but are able to retrieve this easily.
* **The Curious**
    They are not sure what they want yet and are drawn in by ideas. They mainly want an unbiased point of view.
* **The Detailed**
    They want to fully understand an issue, to connect all the dots to improve the system.
* **The Focused**
    They know what they want and want easy access to the data.
* **The Diggers**
    They need raw data, to conduct their own research and connect the unconnected.

## Design decisions
Our products most important design decisions were the following:

* Light / Dark mode
* Saving your research progress in boards
* Linking pieces of data together in multiple ways

## User goal
The most important user goal is for the user to be able to effectively draw conclusions form their research by storing and linking the data.
