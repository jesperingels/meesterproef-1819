# Reflection

## Web App From Scratch
This course is one of the courses I used most in this project since React and most definitely Typescript forces you to work in a **structured** manner. This was more a group decision since I hadn't worked with React or Typescript before. I'd say structuring my code is what I spend most of my time on, because I had a hard time learning React and Typescript. 

Our app isn't exactly '**from scratch**' since we used libraries and a framework like React. But nevertheless we(mostly Maikel van Veen) did set-up our own file structure. At least I worked with it and understood the way it was structured and how to work with it. 

I was constantly **refactoring** my code to fit in the framework and Typescript standards. And still others changed my code to even further optimize it. It was also a good thing so I good see how I good write even cleaner code. They were mostly ES6 things, I thought I knew most ES6 syntax, turns out I don't! 

## CSS-to-the-rescue
I think I continued the 'CSS to the rescue' in this project. I was always searching for ways to implement fun CSS interactions or animations. Since I didn't create that many features (because of the steep learning curve of React and Typescript) I didn't get to implement much CCS 'tricks'. But I did get there eventually, I wanted to show the cool things you can do if you **experiment** with the `transform:` property and especially `rotate3d()`. So I created a cool and meaningful interaction you can read in the [product biografie](https://github.com/jesperingels/meesterproef-1819/tree/master/product-biografie). 

CSS is one of the courses I was best at during this minor so at first I wanted to show what I can do during this project. But I came to the conclusion that it's better to work on things I'm not so good at yet like Web Apps From Scratch, which I really improved on compared to the start of this minor. Overall my technical skills have skyrocketed compared to the start of this minor, which I'm very pleased about. 

## Browser Technologies
Browser Technologies is the course that got the least attention this project ðŸ˜¢. This is mainly because we used React, which is build on Javascript. When a user has javascript turned of or it didn't load the entire app won't load. Which is one of the disadvantages of working with React. But React had a lot of other advantages that contributed to my learning process. 

## Web Design 
This is one of the courses I used a lot during the entire process, since I was always thinking about the **user** at every design decision.
I kept asking the difficult questions nobody wanted to hear. But I knew that they'll have to be asked eventually. The questions are mostly the same: Why are we making this? Who's going to use it. Why are they going to use it? How are they going to use it? etc. I usually just sketch to show the rest of the group how I think the user is going to user our product or what the current concept means for the user. 

To test our design choices we held a **user test** with a (medical) student. I prepared for this user test since Web Design was one of my rubrics. I thought I was well prepared, turned out I had to prepare even more. At the start of the test I took the lead and the other encouraged this. After a few questions I knew what I wanted to know but I didn't know how to ask it. So I looked to my fellow students for help and we finished the user test asking questions to the user as a group. 

The test went quite well, the user acknowledged the problem with the current websites build to access the public health data. And said this app could really help them to search and draw conclusions while researching more effectively and efficiently. There was also a menu button we had a discussion about beforehand, whether the user would understand it. Turns out the user didn't even see it! That's why a user test is always better than just debating about what a user could be thinking. 

The preparation for the user test meant writing a short to do list and what I wanted to know. Followed by a **user scenario** / user flow of the app. This really helped to get an overview of what the app is and how it can/should be used. This lined up quite well with what the user did. I think it helped that we kept the app simple, because there aren't many different pages.
